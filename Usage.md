# Usage #
  * Go to the folder you've located the program in Finder.
  * Configure the source directories and backup-destination directories.
  * Open a Terminal and go to the location where you've located the program (e.g.: cd /Users/hshin/Apps/python-backup/src/clinmag-backup/).
  * Run the program by typing in the Terminal: ./clinmag-backup



# Something to bear in mind #
  * You need to maintain the backup database by yourself.
  * That means: you need to delete the old backup file by yourself when the disk becomes full.
